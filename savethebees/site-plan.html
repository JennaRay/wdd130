        Bee populations have been notibly in decline since the 
1990s. Some bee species have already gone extinct, 
while others are currently endangered (Silva). 
According to greenpeace.org, it is usually typical for a 
bee colony to lose about 5-10% of their population over 
the winter, 15-20% on a particullarly bad winter. In the 
US, that rate for bee losses has now reached around 40%, 
twice as much as it would usually be in a very rough 
winter. There are even reports of some beekeepers who 
have a 90% loss rate.3
There is a lot of speculation for what is causing the 
decline in bee populations. Some are natural causes, like 
the vicious varraou mites, one of the the worst pests for 
bees (McChesney)5
. Other factors are caused by man, 
such as habitat loss, use of chemical pesticides and 
herbicides, and climate change

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Where is Bee Decline a Problem?
      
Bee populations have been reportedly in decline in many 
Major countries, such as China, Brazil, North America, and 
many countires in Europe.4

        Who is Affected?

        The decline in the bee population affects many different 
groups of people. It negatively impacts agricultural 
farmers, as bees are necessary for the polination of most 
fruits, and for the seed production of some vegetables 
and important hays. Without bees, these plants would 
not be able to grow, either because they need to be 
pollinated to grow, or they need to be pollinated to 
produce seeds (Brunet, Scienta.global).
The loss of alfalfa hay would impact the livestock 
industry greatly, as it is a common staple in feed for 
livestock such as cows and chickens (Brunet).1
Lastly, the loss of bees would affect the American 
population as a whole, as it would greatly change the 
american diet. Common fruits like apples, blueberries, 
strawberries, and avacados all rely on bee pollination. 
Vegetables like pumpkins, tomatoes, and cucumbers 
would also be effected. (DiValentino, Insider)2 According 
to Greenpeace.org, “Seventy out of the top 100 human 
food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the 
world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.” 3

      <h3>How to Help</h3>
      <p>
        1) Write to congress members in support of the “Saving 
America’s Pollinators Act of 2021”. https://www.govtrack.
us/congress/bills/117/hr4079/comment
2) Plant bee friendly plants 
- alyssum, cleome, zinnias, sunflowers, salvia, calendula, 
and verbena.
- sage, thyme, borage, lavender, chives, dill, basil, 
oregano, rosemary, and mint

3) Become a beekeeper
4) Spread the word
