            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <h3>Where is bee decline a problem?</h3>
            <p>Bee populations have been reportedly in decline in many 
                Major countries, such as China, Brazil, North America, and 
                many countires in Europe.</p>
            <h3>Who is affected by the loss of bees</h3>
            <p>The decline in the bee population affects many different 
                groups of people. It negatively impacts agricultural 
                farmers, as bees are necessary for the polination of most 
                fruits, and for the seed production of some vegetables 
                and important hays. Without bees, these plants would 
                not be able to grow, either because they need to be 
                pollinated to grow, or they need to be pollinated to 
                produce seeds (Brunet, Scienta.global).</p></section>

            <p>The loss of alfalfa hay would impact the livestock 
                industry greatly, as it is a common staple in feed for 
                livestock such as cows and chickens (Brunet). <br><br>
                Lastly, the loss of bees would affect the American 
                population as a whole, as it would greatly change the 
                american diet. Common fruits like apples, blueberries, 
                strawberries, and avacados all rely on bee pollination. 
                Vegetables like pumpkins, tomatoes, and cucumbers 
                would also be effected (DiValentino, Insider). According 
                to Greenpeace.org, “Seventy out of the top 100 human 
                food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the 
                world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.” </p>
