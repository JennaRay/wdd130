        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <h3>Where is bee decline a problem?</h3>
        <p>Bee populations have been reportedly in decline in many 
            Major countries, such as China, Brazil, North America, and 
            many countires in Europe.4</p>
        <h3>Who is affected by the loss of bees</h3>
        <p>The decline in the bee population affects many different 
            groups of people. It negatively impacts agricultural 
            farmers, as bees are necessary for the polination of most 
            fruits, and for the seed production of some vegetables 
            and important hays. Without bees, these plants would 
            not be able to grow, either because they need to be 
            pollinated to grow, or they need to be pollinated to 
            produce seeds (Brunet, Scienta.global).</p>

        <p>The loss of alfalfa hay would impact the livestock 
            industry greatly, as it is a common staple in feed for 
            livestock such as cows and chickens (Brunet).1
            Lastly, the loss of bees would affect the American 
            population as a whole, as it would greatly change the 
            american diet. Common fruits like apples, blueberries, 
            strawberries, and avacados all rely on bee pollination. 
            Vegetables like pumpkins, tomatoes, and cucumbers 
            would also be effected. (DiValentino, Insider)2 According 
            to Greenpeace.org, “Seventy out of the top 100 human 
            food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the 
            world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.” 3</p>
