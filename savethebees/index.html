        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Bee populations have been notibly in decline since the 
            1990s. Some bee species have already gone extinct, 
            while others are currently endangered (Silva). </p>
        <p>According to greenpeace.org, it is usually typical for a 
            bee colony to lose about 5-10% of their population over 
            the winter, 15-20% on a particullarly bad winter. In the 
            US, that rate for bee losses has now reached around 40%, 
            twice as much as it would usually be in a very rough 
            winter. There are even reports of some beekeepers who 
            have a 90% loss rate.3</p>
        <img src="images/chart1.jpg" alt="Bee Losses in Winter">
        <p>There is a lot of speculation for what is causing the 
            decline in bee populations. Some are natural causes, like 
            the vicious varraou mites, one of the the worst pests for 
            bees (McChesney)5. Other factors are caused by man, 
            such as habitat loss, use of chemical pesticides and 
            herbicides, and climate change</p>
